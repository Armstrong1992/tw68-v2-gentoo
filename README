The files in this subdirectory should be able to be used to compile and
install a driver for the TW6800-series chipset.  In order to do this
compilation, the system being used for compilation should contain the
current kernel sources, or at least the "kernel-headers" and the
"kernel-development" packages (different names may be used for these
on different distrubutions).


Current Status - 13 September 2009 10:30am HK Time
--------------------------------------------------

The basic functionality for using the TW6800 video in "grabdisplay" mode
is reasonably stable.  The "overlay" mode and window clipping are not yet
functional.  There is no support for eeprom, audio or transport stream at
this time.

There is a known problem if the application program tries to dynamically
change the scaling of the captured video.  This can result in loss of
picture, and (at least) some logged error messages.
