 *  Part of the device driver for Techwell 68xx based cards
 *
 *  Much of this code is derived from the cx88 and sa7134 drivers, which
 *  were in turn derived from the bt87x driver.  The original work was by
 *  Gerd Knorr; more recently the code was enhanced by Mauro Carvalho Chehab,
 *  Hans Verkuil, Andy Walls and many others.  Their work is gratefully
 *  acknowledged.  Full credit goes to them - any problems within this code
 *  are mine.
